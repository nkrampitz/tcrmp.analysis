\title{Random Point Assignment}
\usage{
pt_assign(pts, path, color)
}
\arguments{
\item{pts}{specifies the number of random points to superimpose on images.}

\item{path}{pathway to folder in which images are located and to which new
images with assigned points will be saved.}

\item{color}{(optional) specifies the color of points and text.}
}
\description{
Superimposes random points to images and assigns letter values
to individual points for the primary purpose of identifying benthic cover.
}
\details{
The maximum number of points that can be assigned to a single image
is 52 (labels: A-Z, a-z).

The pathway should direct to a folder containing only images for
point assignment.

Dimensions of input images are automatically detected and new images
of the same size with assigned points are saved under the original file
name with the ending "\code{_pts}".

The default \code{color} is red. However, \code{color} may take any
single color (i.e. \code{"blue"}, \code{"yellow"}) or base color ramp
(i.e. \code{\link[grDevices:heat.colors]{heat.colors}},
\code{\link[grDevices:rainbow]{rainbow}}, etc.). If using a color ramp,
\code{n} is equal to the number of points.
