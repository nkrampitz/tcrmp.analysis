\description{
A dataset containing algae canopy height data from TCRMP locations.
Each row represents an individual height measurement on a transect at
a location for one sampling period. All height measurements are
recorded in centimeters. Encrusting macroalgae are typically not
measured and are represented by a height value of 0.0 or "NA".
Variables are defined below.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item Location. Monitoring location name
\item SampleYear. Monitoring period in which that data was
collected. Note - SampleYear may not always match the year
from the benthic sample date.
\item SampleMonth. Month in which data was collected. Note -
when a location was not surveyed fully in the same month, the
month in which sampling began is used as the sample month.
\item Period. Sample period in which the data falls. "Annual"
refers to normal annual TCRMP sampling. "PeakBL" refers to
additional sampling to capture peak bleaching due to thermal
stress. "PostBL" refers to additional sampling as a follow up
to thermal stress. "SCTLD" refers to additional sampling at a
subset of TCRMP locations to monitor the progression of Stony
Coral Tissue Loss Disease. "WS" refers to additional sampling
at a subset of TCRMP locations during research cruises aboard
the R/V Walton Smith.
\item SampleDate. Date on which algae height sampling was
conducted at the monitoring location
\item Transect. Permanent transect number (1-6)
\item Substrate. Indicates the genus or type of algae
\item Height. Height of algae (when applicable) in cm
