\title{TCRMP Report Fish Summary Figures}
\usage{
create_fig_fish_sum(df, sample_years, path)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{a data frame containing mean abundance, biomass, and
SEM by location for each sampling period.}

\item{sample_years}{vector of years (\code{c(start, end)}) to include
in overall summary figures.}

\item{path}{a file pathway to where summary \code{.jpg}s should be
saved.}
}
\description{
Creates summary figures of fish abundance and biomass
from data collected by the US Virgin Islands Territorial Coral
Reef Monitoring Program (TCRMP) for a specified range of years.
}
\details{
The figures created match the format of those published in
the annual TCRMP report. Annual reports can be found at:
