\description{
A dataset containing dates on which temperature loggers were
swapped for each TCRMP location. Variables are defined below.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item Location. Monitoring location name
\item SampleDate. Date on which coral health assessment sampling
was conducted at the monitoring location
\item SampleYear. Monitoring period in which that data was
collected. Note - SampleYear may not always match the year
from the benthic sample date.
\item SampleMonth. Month in which data was collected. Note -
when a location was not surveyed fully in the same month, the
month in which sampling began is used as the sample month.
\item Period. Sample period in which the data falls. "Annual"
refers to normal annual TCRMP sampling. "PeakBL" refers to
additional sampling to capture peak bleaching due to thermal
stress. "PostBL" refers to additional sampling as a follow up
to thermal stress. "SCTLD" refers to additional sampling at a
subset of TCRMP locations to monitor the progression of Stony
Coral Tissue Loss Disease. "WS" refers to additional sampling
at a subset of TCRMP locations during research cruises aboard
the R/V Walton Smith.
