\description{
A dataset containing \emph{Diadema antillarum} density in which
each row represents the density of one transect at a location for
one sampling period. Variables are defined below.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item Location. Monitoring location name
\item SampleYear. Monitoring period in which that data was
collected. Note - SampleYear may not always match the year
from the benthic sample date.
\item Period. Sample period in which the data falls. "Annual"
refers to normal annual TCRMP sampling. "PeakBL" refers to
additional sampling to capture peak bleaching due to thermal
stress. "PostBL" refers to additional sampling as a follow up
to thermal stress. "SCTLD" refers to additional sampling at a
subset of TCRMP locations to monitor the progression of Stony
Coral Tissue Loss Disease. "WS" refers to additional sampling
at a subset of TCRMP locations during research cruises aboard
the R/V Walton Smith.
\item Transect. Transect number
\item DiadDens. \emph{Diadema antillarum} density as individuals
per 100 sq. meters
