\description{
A dataset containing fish abundance and biomass from TCRMP fish
census surveys in which each row represents a species on a transect
at a location for one sampling period. Variables are defined below.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item Location. Monitoring location name
\item Month. Month in which data was collected. Note -
when a location was not surveyed fully in the same month, the
month in which sampling began is used as the sample month.
\item Year. Year in which data was collected.
\item SampleYear. Monitoring period in which that data was
collected. Note - SampleYear may not always match the year
from the benthic sample date.
\item Period. Sample period in which the data falls. "Annual"
refers to normal annual TCRMP sampling. "PeakBL" refers to
additional sampling to capture peak bleaching due to thermal
stress. "PostBL" refers to additional sampling as a follow up
to thermal stress. "SCTLD" refers to additional sampling at a
subset of TCRMP locations to monitor the progression of Stony
Coral Tissue Loss Disease. "WS" refers to additional sampling
at a subset of TCRMP locations during research cruises aboard
the R/V Walton Smith. "PostHurr" refers to additional sampling
after the passage of Hurricanes Irma and Maria in September 2017.
\item Transect. Transect number
\item ScientificName. Species scientific name
\item CommonName. Species common name
\item TrophicGroup. Trophic group to which the species belongs
(i.e. herbivore, omnivore, piscivore, etc.)
\item Metric. Species abundance or biomass (kg) per 100 sq.
meters.
\item Total. Total number of individuals observed per 100
sq. meters or total biomass (kg) per 100 sq. meters.
