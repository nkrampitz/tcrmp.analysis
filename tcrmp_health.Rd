\description{
A dataset containing coral health assessment data from TCRMP locations.
Each row represents the health assessment of an individual colony on a
transect at a location for one sampling period. All interaction variables
are recorded as percent of live coral tissue affected unless otherwise
noted. Variables are defined below.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item Location. Monitoring location name
\item SampleYear. Monitoring period in which that data was
collected. Note - SampleYear may not always match the year
from the benthic sample date.
\item SampleMonth. Month in which data was collected. Note -
when a location was not surveyed fully in the same month, the
month in which sampling began is used as the sample month.
\item Period. Sample period in which the data falls. "Annual"
refers to normal annual TCRMP sampling. "PeakBL" refers to
additional sampling to capture peak bleaching due to thermal
stress. "PostBL" refers to additional sampling as a follow up
to thermal stress. "SCTLD" refers to additional sampling at a
subset of TCRMP locations to monitor the progression of Stony
Coral Tissue Loss Disease. "WS" refers to additional sampling
at a subset of TCRMP locations during research cruises aboard
the R/V Walton Smith.
\item Transect. Permanent transect number (1-6)
\item SPP. Scleractinian coral species code. Codes match those
reported in the documentation for TCRMP benthic cover.
\item Length. Maximum colony diameter in cm
\item Width. Colony width in cm measured perpendicular to
length
\item Height. Colony height in cm measured perpendicular to
the plane of growth
\item Dict. \emph{Dictyota} sp. interaction
\item Lobo. \emph{Lobophora} sp. interaction
\item Hali. \emph{Halimeda} sp. interaction
\item Sarg. \emph{Sargassum} sp. interaction
\item Calg. CCA interaction
\item Fil. Filamentous turf algae interaction
\item OtherMaca. Unidentified macroalgae interaction
\item Cyano. Cyanobacteria interaction measured as the
percent of living coral perimeter bordered by cyanobacteria
\item Clio. \emph{Cliona delitrix} interaction measured as the
percent of the colony skeletal structure with emergent
oscula
\item Icing. \emph{Mycale laevis} interaction measured as
presence (P) or absence (NA)
\item Spo. Unidentified sponge interaction
\item Gorg. Unidentified gorgonian interaction
\item Worm. Unidentified worm interaction
\item Sed. Sediment interaction
\item Other. Miscellaneous interaction
\item NoDam. Total number damselfish by species present at a
colony
\item NoCvore. Total number coralivores present at a colony.
\item Pred. Predation interaction
\item Damage. Notes indicating colony damage
\item BLP. Code indicating coral bleaching (BL) or paling (P)
\item BL. Percent living colony tissue bleached
\item P. Percent living colony tissue pale
\item VP. Percent living colony tissue very pale
\item SP. Percent living colony tissue slightly pale
\item TotBL. Total percent living colony tissue bleached or pale
\item OldMort. Percent old partial mortality
\item RecMort. Percent recent partial mortality
\item TotMort. Total percent partial mortality
\item Dis1. Primary coral disease identification. Disease codes
are as follows: ATL (acute tissue loss), BBD (Black Band Disease),
DCOR (disease coral/unidentifed lesion), DSD (Dark Spot Disease),
IMS (Intercostal Mortality Syndrome), PLA (White Plague), SCTLD
(Stony Coral Tissue Loss Disease), UNK (Unknown disease), WBD
(White Band Disease), YBD (Yellow Band Disease).
\item Dis2. Secondary coral disease identification. Disease codes
are as above.
\item ATL. Percent colony affected by acute tissue loss
\item BBD. Percent colony affected by Black Band Disease
\item DCOR. Percent colony affected by an unidentified lesion
\item DSD. Percent colony affected by Dark Spot Disease
\item IMS. Percent colony affected by Intercostal Mortality Syndrome
\item PLA. Percent colony affected by White Plague
\item SCTLD. Percent colony affected by Stony Coral Tissue Loss Disease
\item UNK. Percent colony affected by an unknown disease
\item WBD. Percent colony affected by White Band Disease
\item YBD. Percent colony affected by Yellow Band Disease
\item TotDis. Total percent colony affected by disease
