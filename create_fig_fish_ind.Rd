\usage{
create_fig_fish_ind(
  abun_df,
  biom_df,
  trophic_df,
  sample_year,
  path,
  gbf_incl = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{abun_df}{a data frame containing fish abundance by species.}

\item{biom_df}{a data frame containing mean fish biomass and SEM by
species.}

\item{trophic_df}{a data frame containing fish trophic level species
richness and proportion of total richness.}

\item{sample_year}{sample year for which location specific summary
figures should be created.}

\item{path}{file pathway to where summary \code{.jpg}s should be
saved.}

\item{gbf_incl}{determines whether a location specific \code{.jpg}
should be created (\code{TRUE}) for the monitoring location Ginsburg
Fringe. If no fish data was collected at this location for the
\code{sample_year} indicated, this parameter should be set to \code{FALSE}.}
}
\description{
Creates location-specific summary figures of
fish community metrics collected by the US Virgin Islands
Territorial Coral Reef Monitoring Program (TCRMP).
}
\details{
The figures created match the format of those published in
the annual TCRMP report. Annual reports can be found at:
(\url{https://sites.google.com/site/usvitcrmp/tcrmp-reports})

The default value of \code{gbf_incl} is \code{TRUE}.
