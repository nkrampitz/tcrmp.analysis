\title{Calculate Degree Heating Weeks}
\usage{
calc_dhw(path, bl_th, project)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{file pathway to where individual \code{.csv} files are located
and to which the compiled file will be saved.}

\item{bl_th}{a data frame containing the bleaching thresholds (BT) and
monthly maximum mean (MMM) for all locations (Location) with files
in the pathway.}

\item{project}{project name to include in file names.}
}
\description{
Calculates degree heating weeks from raw temperature
data. Degree heating weeks (DHW) illustrate heat stress at a location
over the previous 3 months as a running sum of the devation over the
bleaching threshold.
}
\details{
All temperature files should be in the same file format
and include 4 columns: Location, Date, Time, and Temperature.

calc_dhw("C:/Users/User/Documents/TemperatureFiles",
         tcrmp_bl_th, "TCRMP")
